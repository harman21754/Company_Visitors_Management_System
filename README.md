# Company Visitors Management System

## Description
This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) based Company Visitors Management System implemented in C++. It allows for basic management of visitor records, including registration, check-in, and check-out functionalities.

## Features
- Register new visitors
- Check-in visitors
- Check-out visitors
- Display all visitor records

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Standard C++ libraries

## Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:
g++ -std=c++11 visitor_management.cpp -o visitor_management
## Usage
After compilation, run the program using:
./visitor_management
Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system:

1. Register Visitor
2. Check In Visitor
3. Check Out Visitor
4. Display Visitors
5. Exit

## Class Structure
- `Visitor`: Represents a visitor with attributes like name, ID, check-in time, and check-out time.
- `VisitorManagementSystem`: Manages the overall system, including visitor registration, check-in/out operations, and displaying visitor information.

## Data Storage
The program uses a vector to store visitor information in memory. Note that this data is not persistent and will be lost when the program terminates.

## Limitations
- The system does not include persistent data storage.
- There's no advanced error handling or input validation.
- The time format is simple string input and does not perform time calculations or validations.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement persistent data storage (e.g., file I/O or database integration)
- Add more robust error handling and input validation
- Implement a more sophisticated time management system
- Add reporting and analytics features
